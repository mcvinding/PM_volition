# Volition in Prospective Memory

The repository contains scripts for data analysis, the experimental paradigm, and data files for our behavioural study on the effect of volition in prospective memory. Please read this document about what you find in this folder and permission on how to use the content.

For more information about the study please see our forthcoming paper:

## Content

The folder *Dataanlysis* contains script in *R* and *Python* to analyse data exactly as described in our paper. The main anlysis used the [HDDM](http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/) package for Python (2.7).

The folder *Datafiles* contains a .csv file with the data collected in the study in anonymized form.

The folder *Paradigm* contains scripts for running the behavioural task described in our paper using PsychoPy  ([http://www.psychopy.org/](http://www.psychopy.org/)).

The file _pm-volition demo.ogv_ is a short video illustrating the behavioural task.
